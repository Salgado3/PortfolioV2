        <p>Hello! My name is Jaime. I fell in love with technology over the years by seeing the impact it has to change the world. We use technology to order our food, schedule our doctor’s appointments, and keep in touch with family. I studied psychology in undergrad because I have an intrinsic motivation to help others. After graduating, I volunteered a year of service at Americorps and then worked my way up at a start-up. I had the opportunity to witness the impact that tech can have in making a stressful situation a bit less scary. I want to build and create products that are useful, have a low barrier of entry, and ultimately brighten up peoples’ days. Let's chat! 
        </p>
